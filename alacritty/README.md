## Installing Charcoal for Alacritty
Before we begin our installation, we must have a text-editor(i.e. Neovim, VSCode,
Notepad etc.) as you will have to edit some files.

Now, we will clone the Charcoal Repository with the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mubin6th/charcoal
```

You can then `cd` or go to the `charcoal/alacritty/` directory. Then, choose the theme file
you want to install. Then, Open it through a text-editor. After that, copy all the text
and paste it on top of `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml` (for Linux & Mac) or
`%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml` (for Windows) file. Lastly, make sure to save the
file.

After saving the file, Charcoal is installed.
