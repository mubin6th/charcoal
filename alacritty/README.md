## Installing Charcoal for Alacritty
In order to install Charcoal for the Alacritty terminal, you will have to edit some
files. You can use your favourite text-editor. Copy the contents of your preferred
colorscheme from Charcoal Repository's `alacritty/` folder. After you have copied all the
contents of your preferred theme file, paste it at the top of your
`~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`.
