## Install
Currently the theme is only available for Neovim. The
[echasnovski/mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) plugin set is used for
this colorscheme. You have to make sure you have **lazy.nvim** installed. You can install
[charcoal dark](https://github.com/mubin6th/charcoal/blob/master/charcoal_dark.lua)
or [charcoal light](https://github.com/mubin6th/charcoal/blob/master/charcoal_light.lua)
from the hyperlinks.

## Needed Improvements
I'm not great at making colorschemes. As a result the colors I've choosen can be far
better. I am specially curious to improve the `charcoal_light` color scheme as it
greatly lacks contrast. Any contribution is greatly accepted!

## Contribute
Currently, there are no accent colors to the theme. I would like to add accent colors as
they are sometimes required for applications. If you want to **suggest** any change to
the palette, let me know. I will kindly take your opinion, Insha'allah.
