## Install
Currently the theme is only available for Neovim. The
[echasnovski/mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) plugin set is used for
this colorscheme. There is currently only dark version (light is comming soon) of the
colorscheme. Install it from [here].

## Contribute
Currently, there are no accent color to the theme. I would like to add accent colors as
they are sometimes required for applications. If you want to **suggest** any change to
the palette, let me know. I will kindly take your opinion, Insha'allah.
