## About
Charcoal is a warm monochromatic colorscheme for text-editors, terminals, UI and more.
The colorscheme resembles warm/rural weather, wheat field, afternoon sky etc. The dark
background of Charcoal Dark is meant to help distinguish UI from Code. Charcoal is
inspired by Gruvbox and Grubox Material colorschemes and tries to be simple and
easy-on-eyes theme.

### Features
- Warm and easy-on-eyes colors.
- Total of 10 monochromatic colors for each mode.
- Simple dark and light shades.
- Support for real-time color editing through [color_grid](https://github.com/mubin6th/charcoal/blob/develop/color_grid).
- **Soon**: Support for many text-editors and terminals.
