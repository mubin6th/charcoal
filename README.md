## Install
Currently the theme is only available for Neovim. The
[echasnovski/mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) plugin set is used for
this colorscheme. You have to make sure you have **lazy.nvim** installed. You can
currently only install [charcoal dark](https://github.com/mubin6th/charcoal/blob/master/nvim/charcoal_dark.lua) from the hyperlink.

## Contribute
If you want to **suggest** any change to the palette, let me know. I will kindly take your opinion, Insha'allah.
