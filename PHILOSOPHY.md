# The Philosophy Of Charcoal

## The Kind of Colorscheme
Charcoal Theme is targetting to be a warm colorscheme. It tries to resemble afternoon
forest, wheat field or a warm environment.


Colors should be warm and distinct from one another. The colorscheme will have enough
contrast to distinguish elements of ui and code. The very dark background of the theme is
meant to reduce eye-strain and look beautiful. The foreground colors are lightly tinted
warm.


## Inspiration
The colorscheme is mainly inspired by the Gruvbox and Gruvbox Material colorschemes. In
the past I used to use Gruvbox and soon moved to Gruvbox Material. The colors and the
order of them in code were indeed really good. But after a while the different hues and
saturations disturbed me in my code (Personal Opinion).


After this, I had the urge to create my own colorscheme.


## Monocromacy
Currently, Charcoal is a monochrome only colorscheme, many have liked it. So to add accent
colors to the theme isn't a high priority. There are 10 colors for dark and light mode
each. The current priority is to work on perfecting the colors.


## Shades of Colors
The dark and light mode of Charcoal has 10 shades of colors. 5 of them are black while the
other 5 are white both are tinted warm. The background colors should be low contrast for
UI elements. High contrast background colors may make the UI elements look complicated
than it is. The foreground colors should have more contrast to seperate elements of code.
Otherwise, all code may look the same and and become bland.


The use of these shades should not be arbitary. They should follow specific rules. For
example, in code, variables, functions, keywords should have colors that resemble their
property.


## Epilogue
As a beginner to making colorscheme, searching for perfect colors is a bit difficult.
Repeated trial and refinement is required to reach a satisfactory state. Currently,
Charcoal has not reached the state. The colors sometimes look a bit less contrasty.


There is also the consideration in displays. In one display a colorscheme may look good
but in another it doesn't look the same. Therefore, a display with good viewing angles
is required to make a colorscheme. *Personal Trick*: If you don't a have a good enough
display for color editing, you can use a phone that has good viewing angles(a lot do)
and get the colors from there.
